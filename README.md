# joc

Joc is the platform basis for WIN WIN ðŸŒˆ.

WIN WIN is a discussion and participatory performance based on consensus and inspired simultaneously from the likes of digital algorithms like paxos, movements and flat hierarchical organizational structures like occupy, holacracy and sociocracy and borrows a bit from anarchist philosophy, the squatting movement and the dutch polder model.

WIN WIN does not promise consensus on a starting statement but rather uses a tree descent algorithm to uncover moments of consensus in a complex conversation.

## Starting joc

    $ ./server.sh

You will prompted to enter a statement on which to look for moments of concensus.

    Enter the starting question: <THE STATEMENT>

For example: "Friends who fly be shamed."

## Notes

`index.html` contains an initalization for a web socket connection.  You probably want to change that... ðŸ˜€
