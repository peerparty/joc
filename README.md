# joc

Joc is the platform basis for WIN WIN ðŸŒˆ.

WIN WIN is a discussion and participatory performance based on consensus and inspired simultaneously from the likes of digital algorithms like paxos, movements and flat hierarchical organizational structures like occupy, holacracy and sociocracy and borrows a bit from anarchist philosophy, the squatting movement and the dutch polder model.

WIN WIN does not promise consensus on a starting statement but rather uses a tree descent algorithm to uncover moments of consensus in a complex conversation.

## Starting joc

    $ ./server.sh

For example: "Friends who fly be shamed."

# Websocket messages

All messages between components and actors are delivered via web sockets in JSON packages.
